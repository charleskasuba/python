Visual Studio Code on Windows
Installation
Download the Visual Studio Code installer for Windows.
Once it is downloaded, run the installer (VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe). This will only take a minute.



Install and Setup VSCode
Preface/Explanation
VSCode is the text-editor that we support in this class for editing files. We recommend VSCode because it is a feature-rich text editor that has a wide array of different community-made extensions that we use in this course that add useful features to the editor.

Steps
Download and run the VSCode installation from here: https://code.visualstudio.com/
<img width="960" alt="vscodePreDownload" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e90f8d3f-b0cf-4c6e-8799-eac655e3329a">
<img width="960" alt="vscodePostDownload" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be9deaa9-afa8-495c-ba46-37afccfadb81">

First, we will download the required Javascript tools and language support through the welcome page

<img width="1680" alt="installJavascript" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d7cd15a-2d8d-4110-8ca3-8f0ae678f1f2">






By default, VS Code is installed under C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code.
Alternatively, you can also download a Zip archive, extract it and run Code from there.

Tip: Setup will add Visual Studio Code to your %PATH%, so from the console you can type 'code .' to open VS Code on that folder. You will need to restart your console after the installation for the change to the %PATH% environmental variable to take effect.

steps to install and set up Visual Studio Code:

Go to the Visual Studio Code website and download the installer for your operating system.Here


Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install VS Code.
After installation, open VS Code from your system's application launcher.
Customize VS Code by installing extensions for programming languages, themes, and tools.
Configure Git within VS Code or install a Git extension for version control.
Customize your preferences and settings by accessing the "Settings" option.
Start a new project or open an existing one by selecting a folder.
Begin coding, use integrated terminal, and run your programs from VS Code.
Utilize the debugging features by adding breakpoints and running your code in debug mode
User setup versus system setup
VS Code provides both Windows user and system level setups.

The user setup does not require Administrator privileges to run as the location will be under your user Local AppData (LOCALAPPDATA) folder. Since it requires no elevation, the user setup is able to provide a smoother background update experience. This is the preferred way to install VS Code on Windows.

Note: When running VS Code as Administrator in a user setup installation, updates will be disabled.

The system setup requires elevation to Administrator privileges to run and will place the installation under the system's Program Files. The in-product update flow will also require elevation, making it less streamlined than the user setup. On the other hand, installing VS Code using the system setup means that it will be available to all users in the system.

See the Download Visual Studio Code page for a complete list of available installation options.

Updates
VS Code ships monthly releases and supports auto-update when a new release is available. If you're prompted by VS Code, accept the newest update and it will be installed (you won't need to do anything else to get the latest bits).

Note: You can disable auto-update if you prefer to update VS Code on your own schedule.


installation of python
Introduction

Python is a widely used high-level programming language. It is one of the most popular and flexible server-side programming languages.

Windows does not have the Python programming language installed by default. However, you can install Python on Windows in just a few easy steps.

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install and set up Python on Windows.

Prerequisites

A system running Windows 10 with administrator access.
Access to the command prompt.
Access to a web browser.
Python Installation on Windows
The installation requires downloading the official Python .exe installer and running it on your system. The sections below will explain several options and details during the installation process.

Step 1: Select Python Version
Deciding on a version depends on what you want to do in Python. The two major versions are Python 2 and Python 3. Choosing one over the other might be better depending on your project details. If there are no constraints, choose whichever one you prefer.

We recommend Python 3, as Python 2 reached its end of life in 2020. Download Python 2 only if you work with legacy scripts and older projects. Also, choose a stable release over the newest since the newest release may have bugs and issues.

Step 2: Download Python Executable Installer
Start by downloading the Python executable installer for Windows:

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the Downloads for Windows section of the official Python website.

2. Locate the desired Python version.

![python-executable-download-page-64-and-32-bit](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5351c3b-4c0b-4c4c-8155-575105aca8dd)

   3. Click the link to download the file. Choose either the Windows 32-bit or 64-bit installer.

The download is approximately 25MB.

Step 3: Run Executable Installer
The steps below guide you through the installation process:

1. Run the downloaded Python Installer.

2. The installation window shows two checkboxes:

Admin privileges. The parameter controls whether to install Python for the current or all system users. This option allows you to change the installation folder for Python.
Add Python to PATH. The second option places the executable in the PATH variable after installation. You can also add Python to the PATH environment variable manually later.


<img width="400" alt="python-installer-admin-privileges-and-path" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/832722cc-2c9c-4d16-b907-680e9f6d14ae">


For the most straightforward installation, we recommend ticking both checkboxes.

3. Select the Install Now option for the recommended installation (in that case, skip the next two steps).

To adjust the default installation options, choose Customize installation instead and proceed to the following step.

<img width="400" alt="python-installer-install-now-or-customize" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/637a6b08-dcce-4952-86ca-09af3e3a14f1">


The default installation installs Python to C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python[version] for the current user. It includes IDLE (the default Python editor), the PIP package manager, and additional documentation. The installer also creates necessary shortcuts and file associations.

Customizing the installation allows changing these installation options and parameters.

4. Choose the optional installation features. Python works without these features, but adding them improves the program's usability.
<img width="400" alt="python-installer-optional-features" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79cd8b5b-59a9-400e-a819-c4d41c5c4fd6">

Click Next to proceed to the Advanced Options screen.

5. The second part of customizing the installation includes advanced options.

Choose whether to install Python for all users. The option changes the install location to C:\Program Files\Python[version]. If selecting the location manually, a common choice is C:\Python[version] because it avoids spaces in the path, and all users can access it. Due to administrative rights, both paths may cause issues during package installation.

Other advanced options include creating shortcuts, file associations, and adding Python to PATH.

<img width="400" alt="python-installer-advanced-options" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcb4da0a-0658-419e-b6b8-4f021ba23555">


After picking the appropriate options, click Install to start the installation.

6. Select whether to disable the path length limit. Choosing this option will allow Python to bypass the 260-character MAX_PATH limit.

<img width="400" alt="python-installer-setup-successful" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b68de882-218e-4b76-8030-c61868088810">

The option will not affect any other system settings, and disabling it resolves potential name-length issues. We recommend selecting the option and closing the setup.

Step 4: Add Python to Path (Optional)
If the Python installer does not include the Add Python to PATH checkbox or you have not selected that option, continue in this step. Otherwise, skip to the next step.

Adding the Python path to the PATH variable alleviates the need to use the full path to access the Python program in the command line. It instructs Windows to review all the folders added to the PATH environment variable and to look for the python.exe program in those folders.

To add Python to PATH, do the following:

1. In the Start menu, search for Environment Variables and press Enter.
<img width="400" alt="start-environment-variables" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a42ab8e-71d9-46eb-9efb-eb4eabe18469">

   2. Click Environment Variables to open the overview screen
  
      <img width="173" alt="system-properties-environment-variables" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fded932-f334-4cb7-950b-2a728252ace0">

      3. Double-click Path on the list to edit it.


       <img width="183" alt="environment-variables-list-path" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5caadde-2580-4ef9-bcde-7ce5d02d355a">

      Alternatively, select the variable and click the Edit button.

4. Double-click the first empty field and paste the Python installation folder path.

5. <img width="182" alt="path-python-pip-new-entry" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad2172f1-60e9-4871-82ab-7656af527fbf">

Alternatively, click the New button instead and paste the path.

5. Click OK to save the changes. If the command prompt is open, restart it for the following step.

Step 5: Verify Python Was Installed on Windows
The first way to verify that Python was installed successfully is through the command line. Open the command prompt and run the following command:

python --version

<img width="400" alt="python-version-3 12 0-cmd-output" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/468660ae-4b85-4045-905d-9c910f09634f">

The output shows the installed Python version.

The second way is to use the GUI to verify the Python installation. Follow the steps below to run the Python interpreter or IDLE:

1. Navigate to the directory where Python was installed on the system.

2. Double-click python.exe (the Python interpreter) or IDLE.

3. The interpreter opens the command prompt and shows the following window:
<img width="400" alt="python-3 12 0-interpreter-window" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d4e43fc-cb9b-4cd6-9480-0ed5461abf40">


step 6: Verify PIP Was Installed
To verify whether PIP was installed, enter the following command in the command prompt:

pip --version


If it was installed successfully, you should see the PIP version number, the executable path, and the Python version:
<img width="400" alt="pip-version-23 2 1-cmd-output" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1621a69f-8463-4af6-b8b7-b960d92ed386">

If it was installed successfully, you should see the PIP version number, the executable path, and the Python version:


then you are ready to go........
